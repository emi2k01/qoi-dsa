# Introduction

The QOI (Quite Ok Image) format is an image format developed not long ago. This
guide will implement a simple decoder for education purposes.

The other purpose of this guide is to try `codasai` in the real world. Dogfooding.

## Creating the project

```console
$ cargo new qoi --lib
```

This creates a Cargo project named "qoi" in a directory with the same name.

Enter the directory and your directory structure should like the one in **Explorer**.
